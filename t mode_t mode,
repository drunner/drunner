       The  cchhmmoodd()  and ffcchhmmoodd() system calls change the permissions of a file.  They differ
       only in how the file is specified:

       * cchhmmoodd() changes the permissions of the file specified whose  pathname  is  given  in
         _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e, which is dereferenced if it is a symbolic link.

       * ffcchhmmoodd() changes the permissions of the file referred to by the open file descriptor
         _f_d.

       The new file permissions are specified in _m_o_d_e, which is a bit mask created  by  ORing
       together zero or more of the following:

       SS__IISSUUIIDD  (04000)  set-user-ID (set process effective user ID on eexxeeccvvee(2))

       SS__IISSGGIIDD  (02000)  set-group-ID (set process effective group ID on eexxeeccvvee(2); mandatory
                         locking, as described in ffccnnttll(2); take a new file's group from par‐
                         ent directory, as described in cchhoowwnn(2) and mmkkddiirr(2))

       SS__IISSVVTTXX  (01000)  sticky bit (restricted deletion flag, as described in uunnlliinnkk(2))

       SS__IIRRUUSSRR  (00400)  read by owner

       SS__IIWWUUSSRR  (00200)  write by owner

       SS__IIXXUUSSRR  (00100)  execute/search by owner ("search" applies for directories, and means
                         that entries within the directory can be accessed)

       SS__IIRRGGRRPP  (00040)  read by group

       SS__IIWWGGRRPP  (00020)  write by group

       SS__IIXXGGRRPP  (00010)  execute/search by group

       SS__IIRROOTTHH  (00004)  read by others

       SS__IIWWOOTTHH  (00002)  write by others

       SS__IIXXOOTTHH  (00001)  execute/search by others

       The effective UID of the calling process must match the owner  of  the  file,  or  the
       process must be privileged (Linux: it must have the CCAAPP__FFOOWWNNEERR capability).

       If the calling process is not privileged (Linux: does not have the CCAAPP__FFSSEETTIIDD capabil‐
       ity), and the group of the file does not match the effective group ID of  the  process
       or  one  of  its supplementary group IDs, the SS__IISSGGIIDD bit will be turned off, but this
       will not cause an error to be returned.

       As a security measure, depending on the filesystem, the set-user-ID  and  set-group-ID
       execution  bits  may be turned off if a file is written.  (On Linux this occurs if the
       writing process does not have the CCAAPP__FFSSEETTIIDD capability.)  On some  filesystems,  only
       the  superuser  can  set  the  sticky  bit, which may have a special meaning.  For the
       sticky bit, and for set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits on directories, see ssttaatt(2).

       On NFS filesystems, restricting the permissions  will  immediately  influence  already
       open files, because the access control is done on the server, but open files are main‐
       tained by the client.  Widening the permissions may be delayed for  other  clients  if
       attribute caching is enabled on them.

   ffcchhmmooddaatt(())
       The ffcchhmmooddaatt() system call operates in exactly the same way as cchhmmoodd(), except for the
       differences described here.

       If the pathname given in _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e is relative, then it is interpreted relative to  the
       directory  referred  to by the file descriptor _d_i_r_f_d (rather than relative to the cur‐
       rent working directory of the calling process, as is done by cchhmmoodd()  for  a  relative
       pathname).

       If  _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e  is  relative  and  _d_i_r_f_d is the special value AATT__FFDDCCWWDD, then _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e is
       interpreted relative to the current working directory of  the  calling  process  (like
       cchhmmoodd()).

       If _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e is absolute, then _d_i_r_f_d is ignored.

       _f_l_a_g_s can either be 0, or include the following flag:

       AATT__SSYYMMLLIINNKK__NNOOFFOOLLLLOOWW
              If  _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e  is a symbolic link, do not dereference it: instead operate on the
              link itself.  This flag is not currently implemented.

       See ooppeennaatt(2) for an explanation of the need for ffcchhmmooddaatt().

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and _e_r_r_n_o  is  set  appropri‐
       ately.

EERRRROORRSS
       Depending on the filesystem, errors other than those listed below can be returned.

       The more general errors for cchhmmoodd() are listed below:

       EEAACCCCEESS Search  permission  is  denied  on  a  component of the path prefix.  (See also
              ppaatthh__rreessoolluuttiioonn(7).)

       EEFFAAUULLTT _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e points outside your accessible address space.

       EEIIOO    An I/O error occurred.

       EELLOOOOPP  Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e.

       EENNAAMMEETTOOOOLLOONNGG
              _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e is too long.

       EENNOOMMEEMM Insufficient kernel memory was available.

       EENNOOTTDDIIRR
              A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       EEPPEERRMM  The effective UID does not match the owner of the file, and the process is  not
              privileged (Linux: it does not have the CCAAPP__FFOOWWNNEERR capability).

       EERROOFFSS  The named file resides on a read-only filesystem.

       The general errors for ffcchhmmoodd() are listed below:

       EEBBAADDFF  The file descriptor _f_d is not valid.

       EEIIOO    See above.

       EEPPEERRMM  See above.

       EERROOFFSS  See above.

       The  same  errors that occur for cchhmmoodd() can also occur for ffcchhmmooddaatt().  The following
       additional errors can occur for ffcchhmmooddaatt():

       EEBBAADDFF  _d_i_r_f_d is not a valid file descriptor.

       EEIINNVVAALL Invalid flag specified in _f_l_a_g_s.

       EENNOOTTDDIIRR
              _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e is relative and _d_i_r_f_d is a file descriptor referring to a  file  other
              than a directory.

       The GNU C library ffcchhmmooddaatt() wrapper function implements the POSIX-specified interface
       described in this page.  This interface differs from the underlying Linux system call,
       which does _n_o_t have a _f_l_a_g_s argument.

   GGlliibbcc nnootteess
       On older kernels where ffcchhmmooddaatt() is unavailable, the  glibc  wrapper  function  falls
       back  to the use of cchhmmoodd().  When _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e is a relative pathname, glibc constructs a
       pathname based on the symbolic link in _/_p_r_o_c_/_s_e_l_f_/_f_d that  corresponds  to  the  _d_i_r_f_d
       argument.
